Machine Learning is divided into:
2.i) Supervised Learning:
        In supervised learning the data for the input and the desired output is provided. The input data is called features, and the
output data is called the target or label. At first machine is taught using the training data (both input and output) is provided.
Then the test data (both input and output) is provided. The test output data is then checked with the output data found in the machine.
Thus the accuracy of the model is found.

2.ii) Unsupervised Learning:


The most popular ways of learning machine learning are:
1. Regression problem:
    Here the difference between the actual output and the machine output are tried to be minimized, so that the best fit is found. Which
is then used to predict the outcome for similar prbolems. It is used to predict problems that has continuous values. 

    Thre are Linear Regression.

2. Classification problem:
    Here specific classes are defined. And machine is taught to classify or categorize the data.
